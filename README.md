# Insurance-Fraud-Prediction-Using-IBM SPSS Modeler


#Project Overview:


This project focuses on detecting fraudulent insurance claims using IBM SPSS Modeler.
By applying Logistic Regression and C&R Tree (Classification & Regression Tree) models, we 
analyze various claim-related factors to identify patterns and predict the likelihood of fraud.



# Problem Statement:


Insurance companies face heavy financial losses due to false or fraudulent claims.

The challenge is to analyze claim data and predict which customers are most likely to file fraudulent claims.

Using SPSS Modeler, this project automates fraud detection and improves risk management.



# The main goal of this project is to:

Identify fraudulent claims based on data patterns.

Reduce losses for insurance companies.

Automate fraud detection using predictive modeling.



# Tools & Techniques Used:

IBM SPSS Modeler – for building and analyzing predictive models

Data Mining Techniques – Logistic Regression, C&R Tree

Data Visualization – Distribution Graphs, Bar Charts

Dataset – https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/buntyshah/auto-insurance-claims-data?select=insurance_claims.csv (features include claim amount, incident severity, hobbies, etc.)



# Workflow:

Data Import – Loaded insurance claim dataset.

Data Cleaning – Removed irrelevant column _c39 using Filter Node.

Visualization – Displayed fraud vs. non-fraud claim ratio

Modeling – Applied Logistic Regression and C&R Tree models.

Evaluation – Compared results and interpreted key predictors.



# Results:


76.7% claims were Non-Fraudulent.

23.3% claims were Fraudulent.

# Conclusion:


The models accurately detected fraudulent claims, providing insights into customer behavior and helping insurers minimize risk and save costs.
